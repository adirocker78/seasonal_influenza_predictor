# ILI Prediction

## Abstract
This repository contains the code used to build my undergraduate thesis. The work was focused on finding a correlation between Wikipedia pages access and the Influenza-like-illness level in Italy. This ansatz is supported by several other papers related to this topic. 

I believe in peer-review and open-source culture, so all the code is freely available and you can download it, play with it etc.
